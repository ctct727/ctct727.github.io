  <div style="background-image:none;"> <p> There is an abundance of clues littered through different pieces of artwork by the Beatles. Most notably in <em>Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Band</em> and in <em> Abbey Road </em>.<br>

     <div style="background-image:none;"><p> The album cover for <em>Abbey Road</em> seems to be a funeral procession for Paul McCartney. In the picture, his eyes are closed and he is out of sync with the others and he is barefoot because he's dead and doesn't need them. Lennon, the one in front wearing white, is the clergy. Starr, following Lennon is a palbearer, and Harrison in the back is the gravedigger given the workclothes he is wearing.<br>

    <div style="background-image:none;"><p>The scene of the cover of <em>Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Band</em> appears to be Paul's burial. He appears corpse like in the photo (in the blue jacket) since he is not facing the camera at an angle; it looks like he is being held up. Also the yellow flowers on the gravesite look like the bass guitar Paul would play because he is left-handed.<br>

    <ul>
    	<li>The black car on the right side of Abbey Road is a police van which references the car accident Paul was in </li>
        <li>On the back of <em>Abbey Road</em> there dots that form the number 3 before the "Beatles" which can be read as "3 Beatles" meaning Paul is dead.</li>
        <li>If you take the design of the drum and mirror it, it appears to spell "1 ONE IX HE DIE" which references 11/9, the day Paul died. </li>
        <li>On the back of the original <em>Sgt. Peppers</em> lyrics are printed on the back and right next to Paul's head are the words "Without You" </li>
