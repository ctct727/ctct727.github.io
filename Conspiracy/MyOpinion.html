      <strong>My Opinion </strong>

     <p style="font-size:16px; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 2px black, 2px 0 black, 0 -2px black;
	 	color:#FFF;">Personally I don't believe this theory at all. It seems too far-fetched for such a famous man like Paul McCartney to die and be seamlessly replaced. Most of the clues are a bit stretched too; a lot of them could just be coincedences. Some clues are just so outlandish they have to made up. Although I think it'd be crazy if this entire theory were true, I really don't believe that it is.

    	<p style="font-size:16px; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 2px black, 2px 0 black, 0 -2px black;">The mirror image theory of the drum is ridiculous to me because it doesn't make any sense and why would the Beatles take the time to do that?

    <p style="font-size:16px; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 2px black, 2px 0 black, 0 -2px black;"> Here's what Paul had to say in an interview with <em>Life</em> magazine:

    <br>
    <p style="font-size:16px; text-shadow: -1px 0 black, 0 2px black, 2px 0 black, 0 -2px black; padding-top:5%;">"It is all bloody stupid. I picked up that OPD badge in Canada. It was a police badge. Perhaps it means Ontario Police Department or something. I was wearing a black flower because they ran out of red ones. It is John, not me, dressed in black on the cover and inside of Magical Mystery Tour. On Abbey Road we were wearing our ordinary clothes. I was walking barefoot because it was a hot day. The Volkswagen just happened to be parked there."
