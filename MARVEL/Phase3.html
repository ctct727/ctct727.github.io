    <p>Still in the earliest stages of development, there is just about zero information on anything in this movie.

    <p>With the introduction of Hope Van Dyne as the Wasp at the end of the Ant-Man movie, the two will take the screen together. Nothing at all has been revealed besides the title. It is likely to focus on the two heroes searching for the original wasp in the quantum realm. However, if the title is a reference to the original comics, then it will feature an alien-criminal as the main villain. </p>
